This project is made in collaboration with Sebastian Leyko, Johannes Sy, and Logan Greenwood as part of our Computing Fundementals class. The goal of this project is to have a fully functioning quizbot.
Given the limited time frame of the project and limited experience our chatbot will most likely be given "context" over actual training.
